# 🌸 Iris Data Analysis & Machine Learning Model 🚀  
**Exploring the Iris Dataset with EDA, Machine Learning, and Flask Web Application**  

---

### 🔎 **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **Iris Data Analysis** project! Here, we explore one of the most famous datasets in machine learning – the **Iris dataset** – and take it through the full pipeline: from data exploration and visualization to building a machine learning model and integrating it into a Flask-based web application. Perfect for those interested in data science and web development!

### 🌟 **Features**

- **User Input Interface**  
   Enter the **sepal** and **petal** dimensions (length and width) of the Iris flower to predict its species.  
   Simple and easy-to-use form design.
  
- **Real-Time Predictions**  
   The model predicts the Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on user input.

- **Beautiful Visualizations**  
   Visualize the dataset through interactive and informative charts using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

- **Flask Integration**  
   Seamlessly integrate machine learning with Flask to deliver instant results directly on a web interface.

### 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

In this phase, we dive deep into the dataset using several techniques:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Visualization**: Create pair plots, histograms, and box plots to gain insights.
- **Statistical Insights**: Calculate key metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation.

---

### 🧠 **Machine Learning Model**

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, followed by scaling for model accuracy.
- **Model Selection**: Tried multiple classifiers and selected the **Naive Bayes** model due to its simplicity and effective performance for this dataset.
- **Evaluation**: The Naive Bayes model performed with high accuracy and is used to make real-time predictions in the web app.

---

### 🌐 **Flask Web Application**

- **index.html**: The form where users input the Iris flower's sepal and petal dimensions.
- **output.html**: Displays the Iris species prediction based on the entered values.

---

### 🌱 **How It Works**

1. **User Input**: The user enters the measurements of the Iris flower.
2. **Model Prediction**: The trained **Naive Bayes** model predicts the species.
3. **Result Display**: The predicted species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) is displayed on the web page.
